# Spend Smart - an app to manage daily budget

## Basic functioning

The app is working on the principle of Tricount or Splitwise but focuses on categorizing spends and allows users to monitor their spend amounts by category.

Users can create budgets that acts like a common pot. Each budget contains lines of spend (single spends eg. tickets for train, groceries shopping). Spends can be added indefinitely.

Each budget can be visualized in details or as a graph by spend category
